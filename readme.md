Is a system to compose and adjust team structures. The ideal team structure i try to recreate is 1 manager, 2 backend developers, 2 designers / frontenders and a qa / tester.

# Scope
For this assignment i prioritise adjusting the teams when created, due to my own reflection and experience, when i assigned or planned task, sometimes a computer will not be able to know who is smart in the scope of the team assignment or someone in the team is available and provide extra value.

Second priority which slight builds on the first, is to acknowledge modern teams is not so square as they look, so what if you need a photographer in your team or you just read that homemade snacks make your team work 40% quicker and need to add a chef to the team?
